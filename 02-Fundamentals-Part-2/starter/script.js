 Look at the console, the function should've console.logged, "My name is Shamal", three times. That's basically It. 


 When writing a function, it can usually give and return data, to use later in the program. Think of it as a conveyer belt machine, put an apple in, you get apple juice.

 Ex:
 */
 function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges, pears, lemons){
     console.log(apples, oranges, pears, lemons);
     const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples, ${oranges} oranges, ${pears}, pears, and ${lemons} lemons. `;
     return juice; 
 } 
 
 // things inside these parenthesis are called Parameters
 // return , returns any value within the function.

 /* 
 So what about the juice variable? Where did that go? The result of running the function IS the juice. These are called arguments. 
              ðŸ‘‡  ðŸ‘‡  ðŸ‘‡  ðŸ‘‡    
*/ 

fruitProcessor(0, 1 , 2, 3); 

/*
If you want to use the value that was returned in this case, juice, you need to store it n a variable. 
*/

const appleJuice = fruitProcessor(0, 1, 2 ,3);
console.log(appleJuice);

/* Now we can reuse it with different arguments and now receive a different output too. 

Ex: 
*/

const appleOrangePearLemonJuice = fruitProcessor(10, 20, 30, 40);
console.log(appleOrangePearLemonJuice);
